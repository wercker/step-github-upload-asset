# GitHub upload asset step

A wercker step for adding an asset to a GitHub release. It has a few parameters, but only two are required: `token` and `file`. See [Creating a GitHub token](#creating-a-github-token).

This step will export the id of the asset in an environment variable (default: `$WERCKER_GITHUB_UPLOAD_ASSET_ID`). This allows other steps to use this release.

Currently this step does not do any json escaping. So be careful when using quotes or newlines in parameters.

# Example

A minimal example, this will get the token from a environment variable, upload a file which is located in the current working directory called `build.tgz` and add it to release `1`:

``` yaml
deploy:
    steps:
        - github-upload-asset:
            token: $GITHUB_TOKEN
            file: build.tgz
            release_id: 1
```

This step works best when used together with the `github-create-release` step, because you can skip setting the `release_id`:

``` yaml
deploy:
    steps:
        - github-create-release:
            token: $GITHUB_TOKEN
            tag: v1.0.0
        - github-upload-asset:
            token: $GITHUB_TOKEN
            file: build.tgz
```

# Common problems

## file: command not found

This happens when the `file` command cannot be found. We use the `file` command to figure out the content-type of the file that will be uploaded. Either you install `file` on your container, or you specify content-type by using the `content-type` property (see [Options](#options)).

## curl: (22) The requested URL returned error: 400

GitHub has rejected the call. Most likely invalid json was used. Check to see if any of the parameters need escaping (quotes and new lines).

## curl: (22) The requested URL returned error: 401

The `token` is not valid. If using a protected environment variable, check if the token is inside the environment variable.

## curl: (22) The requested URL returned error: 422

GitHub rejected the API call. Check if the name of the file isn't already in use in this release.

# Creating a GitHub token

To be able to use this step, you will first need to create a GitHub token with an account which has enough permissions to be able to create releases. First goto `Account settings`, then goto `Applications` for the user. Here you can create a token in the `Personal access tokens` section. For a private repository you will need the `repo` scope and for a public repository you will need the `public_repo` scope. Then it is recommended to save this token on wercker as a protected environment variable.

# What's new

- Initial release.

# Options

- `token` The token used to make the requests to GitHub. See [Creating a GitHub token](#creating-a-github-token).
- `file` The path of the file which you want to add to the release.
- `release_id` (optional) The id of a release where this asset should be uploaded to. Defaults to `$WERCKER_GITHUB_CREATE_RELEASE_ID`, which gets set by the `github-create-release` step.
- `owner` (optional) The GitHub owner of the repository. Defaults to `$WERCKER_GIT_OWNER`, which is the GitHub owner of the original build.
- `repo` (optional) The name of the GitHub repository. Defaults to `$WERCKER_GIT_REPOSITORY`, which is the repository of the original build.
- `filename` (optional) The name of the file on GitHub (make sure this is json encoded, see [TODO](#todo))
- `content-type` (optional) The content-type of the file. Defaults to using the `file` command (make sure this is json encoded, see [TODO](#todo))
- `export_id` (optional) After the asset is uploaded, a asset id will be made available in the environment variable identifier in this environment variable. Defaults to `WERCKER_GITHUB_UPLOAD_ASSET_ID`.

# TODO

- Create better error handling for invalid token.
- Escape user input to be valid json.
- Make sure `export_id` contains a valid environment variable identifier.
